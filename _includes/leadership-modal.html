    <p>Leading any group of people is challenging. Leading smart, hard-working people isn’t any easier. They are the confident team members you want by your side, but they also tend to have the strongest ideas about how things should be done. Every person on my SOURCE team this year was a leader. And every person on my team could have led the team instead of me. I had to ensure that I wouldn’t let them down. Stepping into the Lead Consultant role taught me a leadership strategy that helped me effectively lead this team of ambitious SOURCE consultants. The strategy helped me this past year, and I am certain it will help me lead other people in the future.</p>
    <p>My leadership strategy did not come from any of the leadership biographies I read over the summer. I came into the year unsure of who I wanted to be as a leader. So I did the only thing I knew how to do: I listened. I listened to everything.</p>
    <p>First, I listened to my team. I knew my team was ready to work hard for our nonprofit client. I came in ready to do the same. But listening helped me realize that my team also wanted to become a close group of friends. So we planned a list of activities to do just for the sake of having fun with each other. Picnicing on Mt. Baldy, thrift shopping in LA, and exercising at Roberts Pavilion as a group brought our team together. Although I knew these activities would make us inevitably closer, I didn’t realize that these activities—though completely unrelated to SOURCE—would also make our team wildly more productive. Despite having more than enough school work and other commitments on our plates, we each looked forward to working hard at team meetings because we had developed a strong culture beyond SOURCE work. I would have never learned the power of strong team culture if I had not listened first.</p>
    <p>Second, I listened to our nonprofit client. Organizations are often skeptical of consultants, especially undergraduate consultants. This skepticism is the very feeling that inhibits a productive consultant-client relationship; I needed to build trust. The solution, I found once again, was to listen. I began every client meeting with five minutes of what I called, “state of the nonprofit.” Modeled after The State of the Union, these five minutes were a time for our nonprofit’s leaders to update us on their daily operations. It’s easy for consultants to get caught up in the big picture ideas. But local nonprofits work because they address small, tangible problems every day. These daily actions fuel nonprofit leaders to do the thankless work that they do. SOURCE Consultants are fueled by these actions as well. But our client didn’t fully know that at the start of our partnership. Those five minutes did not explicitly help us address our nonprofit’s problem. However, they were likely the most important part of our client meetings. By actively listening to our client’s daily operations, our client could tell that we shared the same passion for service that was at the heart of the organization. In our client’s mind, we became a part of the nonprofit. It was only then that we were able to make significant strides on our project. I would have never learned the power of trust if I had not listened first.</p>
    <p>Third, I listened to our nonprofit’s volunteers. Our project was to help our nonprofit recruit more volunteers. We could have immediately suggested an arsenal of strategies that SOURCE had used in the past to help nonprofits recruit more volunteers. Our nonprofit would have likely been wowed by our suggestions. But we needed to tailor our work to the nonprofit to find a solution that actually worked and would work in future years. So, before acting, we listened. We realized that the nonprofit already had a cohort of very loyal volunteers. By listening to the volunteers, we learned why people join the nonprofit and why they stay. We learned that working directly with an individual homeless person is a magical experience for volunteers. To help our nonprofit recruit more volunteers, we didn’t have to resort to innovative technology solutions. The nonprofit already had an amazing story. We simply had to tell it in a way that clearly explained why it’s so great to volunteer there. I would have never known about the nonprofit’s story if I had not listened first.</p>
    <p>Being a Lead Consultant this year clarified what leadership is to me. Leading is listening.</p>
