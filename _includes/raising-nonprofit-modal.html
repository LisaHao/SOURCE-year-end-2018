        <p>Most nonprofits are bred from passion; they are coordinated responses to a recognized need. An individual or a group of people is struck by a problem, then sets out to address it. In doing so, they often focus more on their work externally than internally; they focus on where the passion is concentrated. However, despite the undeniable power and momentum born from passion, organizations must also build strong foundations to increase their impact and grow sustainably. Young nonprofits must prioritize internal work and improve internal structure. Ultimately, operational success is reliant on a well-defined mission and vision, a clear organizational structure and a commitment to balancing needs and dreams. </p>
        <p>First, frequent strategic conversations help guide an organization’s constantly evolving mission and vision. A clear mission and vision is essential in guiding all organizational operations, and strategic planning exercises can help provoke honest conversations about where the organization is going five or ten years down the road. Young nonprofits commonly have lofty goals and aspirations. Sometimes, these remain consistent with those identified at the organization’s founding, while other times these have evolved to fit a changing organization, community, or need. Thus, it is important for a young organization to frequently re-evaluate its mission and vision. As time goes on, the organization may get a clearer idea of what exactly its vision looks like in practical terms. For example, an organization may realize that while one program or service perfectly aligns with its mission and vision, another does not. This practice often results in a more narrow, pointed scope, ultimately allowing the organization to realize what it should prioritize and ensure everyone is focused on the same organizational goals. Although disagreement is bound to occur, the core goals and values should be unanimous. Therefore, such conversations provide the necessary direction and purpose for sustainable organizational growth.</p>
        <p>Second, a clear organizational structure ensures that tasks will be completed efficiently and the organization’s impact will continue. It also helps young organizations make the tough, but common transition from being primarily reactive, to more proactive. In other words, rather than urgently, and perhaps frantically, responding to internal or external problems that arise, organizations are able to have measures in place to prevent issues and focus on community impact rather than on ‘putting out fires'. In order to pass this organizational threshold, organizations must formalize and streamline communication processes. It is often helpful to develop ‘best practice’ guides for internal and external communications, along with presentations and any other work that may benefit from stylistic cohesion. Mature nonprofits typically excel because they have the mechanisms to ensure that when a problem or question arises, it is addressed quickly and efficiently.</p>
        <p>Third, a organizational-wide commitment to balancing the nonprofit’s needs, dreams, and personnel cultivates a successful environment for collaboration and ensures sustainability across personnel changes or losses. If roles and expectations are ambiguous, chaos and confusion are bound to impact the nonprofit’s ability to carry out its community work. For instance, if one staff member decides to take a step back or leave the organization, their tasks and commitments are likely to fall through the cracks. Thus, clearly defined roles guarantee sustainability of internal operations and programming; if one person leaves, their role can easily be reassigned or re-worked.  Clearly defined roles and expectations also create a system of accountability and ownership. Work must also be realistically and thoughtfully distributed amongst all staff or leaders of the organization. If the majority of the work falls on one person, then chances of sustainability are slim. Without  established channels of workflow and well-balanced task distribution, the organization both suffers from reduced capacity and risks running its personnel into the ground. Individuals are more likely to leave an organization if they feel that their work is no longer impactful. Thus, balancing internal work with more obviously impactful external work is the key to reminding individuals of their added value.</p>
        <p>Young nonprofits can be daunting; they are largely unstructured and ambiguously defined. Yet, young nonprofits are exciting; they are passionate and full of possibility in their ambiguity of definition. In order to pass the threshold from naivete to maturity, nonprofit organizations have to first look within. After all, they must be raised.</p>
