    <p>Leading my first IdeaJam was both daunting and thrilling. When I first joined SOURCE at the start of the year, I never could have imagined myself taking on so much responsibility as an Associate Consultant. Yet, when I found out that I would be leading an IdeaJam with A Country Called Syria, I was excited to help and hoping for the best.</p>
    <p>IdeaJams are one of the many services SOURCE offers to local nonprofits outside our year-long partnerships. IdeaJams bring a group of SOURCE consultants and a local nonprofit together for a ninety-minute brainstorming session aimed at addressing one of the nonprofitâ€™s organizational problems.</p>
    <p>I had been attending IdeaJams throughout my first year in SOURCE. I enjoyed the great opportunity to build my skills, get experience with different consulting projects, and help more nonprofits in the community. Through IdeaJams, I had already met many inspiring nonprofit leaders who wanted to make a real difference and had worked with a variety of organizations, from tech-based groups to after-school programs. Getting to know these nonprofits and working out ways that I could help them further their missions was one of the most rewarding things I did in SOURCE. </p>
    <p>So when the time came and I was paired with my nonprofit, A Country Called Syria, I felt ready. Founded by a mother and daughter team, A Country Called Syria collects and shows Syrian cultural items at assorted exhibits to show that Syria is more than the war-torn country we often see in the media. Their mission was moving, their work was much needed, and their passion was undeniable. I was excited to be a part of their story, and looking forward to helping them grow.</p>   
    <p>A Country Called Syria wanted help with fundraising and grant-writing. I organized a group of SOURCE Consultants best suited to address their organizational needs. I led the team in researching beforehand and brainstorming alongside the client during the IdeaJam. After the meeting, I consolidated our brainstorming session into actionable steps. We created a tangible plan for the nonprofit to further its grant-writing and fundraising goals. I felt immensely proud.</p> 
    <p> Hosting the session was a huge step for me. I learned how to effectively navigate  the client relationship, coordinate with a consultant team, and find the balance between building rapport and pushing the project forward.</p>
    <p>In general, I think that IdeaJams encapsulate everything that I love about SOURCE. They provide opportunities for all SOURCE members to take the lead, and grow. The IdeaJams lend themselves perfectly to the fast-paced, creative brainstorming that SOURCE students excel at, and they offer nonprofits a unique opportunity to walk away from one meeting with a plan of action for real, sustainable growth. I am excited to continue honing my skills at future IdeaJams. </p>
