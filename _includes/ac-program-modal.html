        <p>When I first applied for SOURCE, I really did not know what I was getting myself into. I knew I loved nonprofits and I kind of knew something about consulting. But I did not expect the amount of support and structure I would receive my first year through the Associate Consultant (AC) Program.</p>
        <p>Mentorship chats, skills training, leadership development, culture events, feedback, and workshops are just a few of the aspects involved in the program. SOURCE turns inexperienced freshmen and sophomores into confident leaders for both client-facing experiences and personal development.</p>
        <p>In one of my first workshops, I learned how to train my client-facing skills. We got into teams and the leads posed scenarios to all of the groups. We had a couple minutes to prepare our answers before going in a circle and explaining what we would do in that situation. While this activity did inflict some stress, each group received immediate feedback, which allowed us to understand where we excelled and where we needed to grow. There were very specific parameters for each answer, and as the rounds continued, each team learned to be more critical of each scenario. I explicitly remember feeling overwhelmed by this competition, yet I learned how to adapt quickly based on the immediate feedback. I could feel myself changing.</p>
        <p>In the second semester, we refined our presentation skills. Roughly a month before the workshop, we had an organization-wide recap, where everyone had to give short speeches describing their semesters’ work. When we came back from winter break, we were asked to revisit those presentations. I explicitly remember feeling rusty as I had not had to present the entire time I was home. I felt myself fumbling through my practice. My words felt like they had just been in a blender and I was unable to remember how to form eloquent sentences. The leads described how to utilize both one’s physical presence—such as body language, intonation, speech—and a clean Powerpoint to deliver the message. I had never really put much thought into the pairing of the two before, yet we had  to redesign our slides based on what we had just learned. When we went to present in front of the workshop, I was still nervous, but I became more conscious of myself as I spoke. As the presentation continued, I felt more confident and more articulate.</p>
        <p>AC Workshops aim to create whole, rounded individuals. We were asked to push ourselves out of our comfort zones. We were asked to assess our strengths and weaknesses, before being taught how to build upon all of those. We were able to grow as an AC class, both professionally and emotionally.</p> 
        <p>When I look at the AC program, I think it truly encapsulates what SOURCE stands for. In many ways, it is the building block of the organization. Everyone from the Senior Advisors to the Associate Consultants themselves understand how the program shapes SOURCE’s mission. Consultants would come into our late night Thursday workshops, when they could be hanging out with friends or doing the work they most definitely had, yet they would come and teach us. Leads would dedicate endless hours to planning, organizing, and creating slideshows for these workshops. Collectively, SOURCE dedicated so many resources into developing the youngest members, showing a type of collaboration and support I really did not expect.</p>
        <p>The relationships cultivated in the AC program help make SOURCE what it is. It involves intense mentorship, yet the work creates the close bond SOURCE prides itself on. Just reflecting on my growth throughout the year was truly incredible. The AC program provides the foundation for both individuals in SOURCE and the group as a whole.</p>
